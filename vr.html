                <p>Although virtual reality has been in existence since the 1990s, its uses have been fairly limited,
                    mostly confined to high-tech gaming consoles. With growing awareness and far-reaching industrial
                    applications, this technology is creating ripples beyond mere entertainment.
                    The scope of virtual reality in applications like training and education, design and prototyping,
                    marketing, travel, therapy, and more is way higher than one can fathom.

                    Virtual reality is a technology that attempts to regenerate computer images and videos to produce
                    real-life visual experiences that are beyond those achieved on the ordinary computer monitor and
                    phone. VR systems do so by using computer vision and advanced graphics to generate 3D images and
                    video by adding depth, and by reconstructing the scale and distances between static 2D images.
                    The user must be able to explore and control these 3D environments using VR headsets lens and
                    controllers which might have sensors on them for users to be able to experience the VR content.</p>

                    VR in industry and work- <br>
                    The pandemic has changed many things about the way we work, including the wholesale shift to home
                    working for large numbers of employees. This brings challenges, including the need to retain an
                    environment that fosters cooperative activity and the building of company culture. Solutions
                    involving VR are quickly emerging to help tackle these.</p>

                    Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that employs pose tracking and 3D near-eye displays
                    to give the user an immersive feel of a virtual world. Applications of virtual reality include
                    entertainment (particularly video games), education (such as medical or military training) and
                    business (such as virtual meetings). Other distinct types of VR-style technology include augmented
                    reality and mixed reality, sometimes referred to as extended reality or XR, although definitions are
                    currently changing due to the nascence of the industry.[1]</p>

                    The VR training doesn't normally start with the intensity of a speech in front of a hostile
                    audience. Yoder will start patients on an easy simulation and then gradually work up the intensity
                    while continuously monitoring their heart rate. The goal is to get to a point where they can
                    confront the source of anxiety or trauma without triggering their flight or fight response. <br>
                    "You can't just take a person with a fear of heights on the first day and throw them on top of the
                    tallest building," Yoder says. "You're not helping them at all there. You have to work up to it."p>
