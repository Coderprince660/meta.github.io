                    Web3 cryptos are a new wave of cryptocurrencies that focus on making the decentralized vision of
                    Web3 a reality. They combine blockchain technology with smart contracts to give people control over
                    their data and make transactions without relying on third parties.
                    Web3 is also known as the third generation of the internet. It aims to remove control from large
                    corporations and operate in a decentralized way that is owned, built and operated by the users
                    themselves</p>

                    The digital age comes with its own lexicon, a bewildering array of buzz phrases, words, and acronyms
                    designed to confuse as much as they are to inform. Many of these new terms have found their way into
                    our everyday vocabularies, although the meanings often get confused and blurred.

                    For instance, many people use “the Web” and “the Internet” interchangeably when they are, in fact,
                    two different things. Furthermore, there’s more than one version of the Web. Are you intrigued yet?

                    This article will help you differentiate between Web 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. It provides a Web 1.0
                    definition, Web 2.0 definition, Web 3.0 definition, Web 1.0 2.0 3.0 examples, and comparisons such
                    as Web 1.0 vs. Web 2.0.</p>
