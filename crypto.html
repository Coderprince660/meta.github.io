                    Cryptocurrency comes under many names. You have probably read about some of the most popular types
                    of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Cryptocurrencies are increasingly
                    popular alternatives for online payments. Before converting real dollars, euros, pounds, or other
                    traditional currencies into â‚¿ (the symbol for Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency), you should
                    understand what cryptocurrencies are, what the risks are in using cryptocurrencies, and how to
                    protect your investment.</p>

                    A cryptocurrency is an encrypted data string that denotes a unit of currency. It is monitored and
                    organized by a peer-to-peer network called a blockchain, which also serves as a secure ledger of
                    transactions, e.g., buying, selling, and transferring. Unlike physical money, cryptocurrencies are
                    decentralized, which means they are not issued by governments or other financial institutions. </p>

                    Cryptocurrencies are created (and secured) through cryptographic algorithms that are maintained and
                    confirmed in a process called mining, where a network of computers or specialized hardware such as
                    application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) process and validate the transactions. The process
                    incentivizes the miners who run the network with the cryptocurrency.

                    Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Monero are popular cryptocurrencies. </p>

                    At its core, cryptocurrency is typically decentralized digital money designed to be used over the
                    internet. Bitcoin, which launched in 2008, was the first cryptocurrency, and it remains by far the
                    biggest, most influential, and best-known. In the decade since, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
                    like Ethereum have grown as digital alternatives to money issued by governments.</p>

                    The most popular cryptocurrencies, by market capitalization, are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and
                    Litecoin. Other well-known cryptocurrencies include Tezos, EOS, and ZCash. Some are similar to
                    Bitcoin. Others are based on different technologies, or have new features that allow them to do more
                    than transfer value.

                    Crypto makes it possible to transfer value online without the need for a middleman like a bank or
                    payment processor, allowing value to transfer globally, near-instantly, 24/7, for low fees.</p>
